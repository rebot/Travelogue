# Travelogue

> A visual guide through bike and hike journeys

Build the project using `yarn run build` and launch the app from the `dist` folder.

## How to use it?

Well, just drag and drop a `.gpx` file in the browser window. The route will be displayed and an animation will start.

In the future, the animation will be related to the scrolling position of the user. Data about the journey, such as references to images and text, will be added to the `.gpx` file and will be loaded alongside the route data. 

## Development

Run the project in development mode using `yarn run debug`. Every time you save one of the project files, the project will be built and a refresh of the page will take place.
